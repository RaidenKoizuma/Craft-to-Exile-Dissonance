## [Unreleased]

### Mod Updates
- Updated MineColonies.

## [2.8.5b] - 2021-01-28

### Mod Updates
- Updated Craft to Exile Custom Uniques.

### Fixes
- Some fixes to uniques.

## [2.8.5] - 2021-01-27

### Updates
- New Patreon-designed unique plate chest by QuetzaCoco: Vessel of Charisma! For those of you who enjoy magic find and raw damage, this is the chest for you! A truly glass-cannon armor, this chest reduces your defensive prowess to give you power overwhelming. Thanks for your support Quetza!
- Increased drop rate of maps.
- Reduced drop rate of unique items and runed gear.
- Increased mob difficulty scaling by about 50% at max level.
- Unique bows have all been given appropriate models and names.
- Overall balance changes regarding uniques. Magic find uniques are generally MORE rare to find now, and some values have been reduced slightly. Some uniques have been reduced in power, and some have been brought back up to "standards". For example, Headhunter's flat physical damage has been changed to percent, and most unique bows have been buffed.
- Productive Bee's Mine and Slash bees have been SUPER, SUPER nerfed.
- Some leather and plate uniques have been standardized with the armor and health stats.

### Mod Updates
- Mine and Slash, Craft to Exile Custom Uniques, Corpse Complex, MineColonies, Xaero's, Productive Bees.

### Fixes
- Hopefully tiers should properly register when uniques drop in non-map worlds now.
- Fixed tooltip error with Stone of Corruption.
- Toolbelts should now retain on death when equipped in their slot.
- Fixed an issue where level 100 items could not roll certain "end-game" sets because the sets were set to level 99.
- Bee bomb crash on servers has been fixed.

## [2.8.4] - 2021-01-20

### Updates
- New Patreon-designed unique bow by Chesty Puller: Righteous Sentience Puller! Check out this awesome build-around bow that scales off of your health. Thanks for your support!
- Huge update to the Mine and Slash talent tree, as well as various game balance changes and bug fixes. View the changelog here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mine-and-slash-reloaded/files/3175536
- You have been provided with another talent reset potion.
- Removed all the loot crates obtainable from the quests. They have been replaced with more modern and specific loot crates. Instead of the generic "equipment" and "currency" crate, we now have weapon, armor, jewelry, warrior/mage/ranger, currency, and map crates. These new crates are also level specific, so no more hoarding crates until you're level 80.
- At the end of every act after Act III, you now receive a map crate.
- Removed the Richard Rider quest and replaced it with a new mob to make the questing experience smoother.
- Reworded some Gaia quests to make them easier to accomplish and combined some of the quests.
- Mining Dimension is now capped at level 50 instead of 100.
- Reduced the amount of flat physical damage you could get from suffixes. The forceful prefix remains unchanged.
- Increased the cost of the crates in Calemi's market by x5. This is NOT in response to any duping bugs, but rather I misjudged how easy it would be to get coins legitimately. You should no longer need to "rely" on these chests while leveling as I have put in a BUNCH of crate rewards from quests. These are meant to be money sinks in the LATE game (70-100).

### Mod Updates
- Updated Productive Bees, Curios, Xaero's, Mine and Slash, Craft to Exile Custom Uniques.

- Fixed some stonecutter issues.

### Updates
- New official Patreon server is packaged with this update!
- Pretty large Mine and Slash update. View the changelog here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mine-and-slash-reloaded/files/3166056!

- Swapped quest positions of Restructurer and Minerals III.
- Players have been provided with more reset potions because of the Mine and Slash update.

## [2.8.2] - 2021-01-06

### Updates
- Sorry for constant updates - I thought the item pickup and suffocation fixes warranted pushing this out early. This should be the last for a while assuming the change directly below doesn't break dimensions.
- Dimensional Dungeons should be able to drop tier 4+ uniques now (may or may not work).
- Pretty large update to Mine and Slash once again. Since all the updates are from M&S this time around, I'll paste the changelog here (rest of Updates is M&S):
- New stat: Spell Lifesteal! Lifesteal, but for spells!
- Added lifesteal and spell lifesteal nodes to the tree.
- Life/spell lifesteal now has a minimum of 1. So even if you do 6 damage with 1% lifesteal, you will still heal 1 HP.
- Major Arcana stat "Judgment" now provides spell lifesteal, and the "thirst of" affixes provide a minor amount of spell lifesteal instead of lifesteal.
- Increased crit hit and damage percents and multis, flat values are still the same.
- Nature's Balm has had its values readjusted again (buff).
- Flat physical damage values have been lowered, but percent has been increased. This means physical will about 20% less damage early game, but investing into physical damage will improve it about 30% more.
- Increased early game effectiveness of Retribution.
- Fixed some localization typos and made some stats/skills more clear. "Judgment" is now spelled correctly, yay!
- Plate gear now also provides armor.
- Leather gear provides a bit less HP.
- Increased durability of equipment, especially at lower rarities.
- Lessened the effect of gear damage on loot drop at lower levels. You will still definitely feel this at higher levels.
- Vanilla ores provide a little more fuel than they used to.
- Setting tiers in the Dimension Config should work now.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Performant, Mine and Slash.

### Fixes
- Suffocation on dimension entry should be fixed.
- Inability to pickup items sometimes should be fixed.
- Fixed invasions being too short.

## [2.8.1c] - 2021-01-06

### Updates
- Some minor balance fixes for Mine and Slash. I went overboard with some nerfs. Also some Hunting buffs (again).

### Mod Updates
- Updated Mine and Slash.

## [2.8.1b] - 2021-01-05

### Fixes
- Fixing dependencies.

## [2.8.1] - 2021-01-05

### Updates
- HUGE Mine and Slash update. You have been provided with a spell reset potion. Check the changelog over at https://github.com/mahjerion/Mine-and-Slash/blob/1.15.2/changelog.txt!
- Greatly reduced frequency of invasions (I'm talking like 10-15x less frequent).
- Legendary Ore Bees are no longer a thing. Misleading since legendary ore doesn't spawn!
- Rathpith's Globe now provides increased critical hit chance instead of flat.
- Disabled Sulfur Bees.
- Reduced critical hit from the unique critical ring.
- Dimensional Dungeon mobs now have much, much more HP.
- Added 2 new Nether quests showcasing the Extended Nether update a bit.
- Changed the dependencies for the quests linked to The Crux to now require Getting Started instead. This should allow for a smoother start.
- Reduced spawn rate of zombies and baby zombies slightly.
- Maps are 33% more likely to drop.
- New updated look for the Craft to Exile menu!

### Mod Updates
- Updated Extended Nether Backport, MineColonies, Mine and Slash, Productive Bees.
- Added FancyMenu.
- Added Open Loader.
- Removed Global Data Pack.
- Removed PackMenu.
- Removed It's The Little Things.
- Removed Better Title Screen.
- Removed XL Packets.

### Fixes
- Disabled jellyfish (and therefore the Jellyfish Bucket) from Upgrade Aquatic as they have been known to cause crashes.
- Nether crashes should more or less be resolved.
- Fixed an issue with Productive Bees datapacks.
- With the removal of It's The Little Things and XL Packets, very rare crashes upon start should be resolved.
- Fixed some broken runewords.

## [2.8.0b] - 2021-01-01

### Fixes
- Fixed Mine and Slash ores not working properly.

## [2.8.0] - 2020-12-31

### Updates
- New Patreon-designed unique ring by Whiterun Mage: Milk Maid's Nose Ring! Thanks for your support!
- 6 new runewords! 5 of which are meant to be mid-level runewords for leveling, and 1 of which is a support runeword!
- Introducing: random invasions! Every 1-2 hours there is a chance than an invasion will trigger. There are currently 3 types of invasions: the undead invasion which can occur in any dimension (except the Good Night Sleep dimensions), the exile invasion which is basically a raid and can occur in any dimension, and a vanilla invasion which can only occur in the Overworld.
- New Mine and Slash bees! Thanks Jonn!
- Mine and Slash ore can now be silk touched and used in technology mods.
- Mine and Slash skills have been slightly balanced again. See the Mine and Slash changelog for more details, but tl;dr fire small nerf, ball spells small nerf.
- You now earn extra total EXP when in a party. See Mine and Slash changelog for details.
- Map drop rates have increased in maps.
- Runewords have been buffed.
- Mobs from raids now scale to player level.
- Nerfed loot and experience gain from Endermen.
- Elder Guardians are now much more difficult and have increased drop rates.
- Decreased Ender Dragon health by 17% and increased damage by 50%.
- Disabled the Legendary Ore --> Penny recipe. It's original purpose was to ensure that servers with limited world gen could still get RC even when raritarium ran out. But with the introduction of RC in Bountiful rewards amongst other things, it's not really needed anymore.
- Gave End: Reborn's Simple Quartz the quartz tag so it's less useless now. Also added a recipe to turn anything tagged as quartz to vanilla quartz, should the need arise.
- Reverted MineColonies citizen tick rates to 1. For the most part, unless you're on a large server, 1 should be fine (does not apply to Official Servers).
- Lycanites bosses can now only be summoned in the Nether.
- Disabled Lycanites taming treats. They were useless since taming was disabled, just misled new players.
- Geodes now give Midnight ores instead of Dark Pearls when thrown.
- Dark Pearl function has been disabled by default.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Serene Seasons, MineColonies, Structurize, Xaero's, Mine and Slash, Productive Bees.
- The update for Create will come in a future update. Still waiting on Create Integration to update.
- Removed Rough Mobs Revamped - doesn't really add much anymore besides mobs with equipment. Granted, removing this may make some of the vanilla mobs "easier", but this mod introduces a lot of issues with entity AI. Will monitor crash rates after removing, if removing this did nothing, I'll probably add it back in.

### Fixes
- Fixed a bunch of log spam by resolving some datapack errors. These were intentional but I found a better way to disable some recipes without breaking the datapack.
- Fixed an impossible Tropics quest.
- A few Mine and Slash party fixes, as well as bleed sound issues.
- Various Productive Bee issues have been fixed. See their changelog for more details.
- Fixed the wording on the Soulstone to not mislead players about taming.
- Tefnut's Call should now be registered as a trident.

## [2.7.3c] - 2020-12-14

### Fixes
- I forgot to include the Global Data Packs folder...

## [2.7.3b] - 2020-12-14

### Fixes
- Fixed a bunch of client-side changes not being implemented server-side.
- Fixed Nasty Mob configs not being applied correctly.

## [2.7.3] - 2020-12-14

### Updates
- You can now wear armor in a cosmetic slot - these pieces won't provide any bonuses but will alter your appearance!
- I decided to remove VanillaDeathChest, and will probably not look into adding any "death chest" mods. I tried testing GraveStone but it lacked some functionality that Corpse and VDC had. Unfortunately, Corpse doesn't work with MineColonies claims, and VDC doesn't respect the Corpse Complex (partial keepinventory rules). Since none of these mods really suit the pack's needs, I've decided to have keepinventory on by default via Corpse Complex with much greater penalties. FWIW, it was also quite troublesome to restore player inventories after bugs/glitches. Your currently existing shulker death chests will remain.
- You now keep your inventory upon death.
- You now lose 33% (up from 25%) of your XP and 33% of the durability on worn items and items on your hotbar. Cosmetic armor do not receive damage.
- Upon spawning, you are afflicted by slowness and hunger.
- Added a quest in Act IV that should help with Draconic Bees.
- Nerfed loot and experience gain from Endermite and Silverfish.
- Added a recipe that can turn non-vanilla forms of cobblestone into vanilla cobblestone.
- Increased update rate of MineColonies citizens.
- Modified some DynView settings for servers to drastically improve performance.
- Lowered Geonach spawn chance in the Mining Dimension.
- Disabled seasonal drop chances from Lycanites Mobs - unfortunately it's completely unconfigurable (it's hardcoded), and they grief...
- Nerfed the effeciency of some Bountiful objectives.
- Increased Dimensional Dungeon drop multiplier by 20%.

### Mod Updates
- Updated MineColonies, Mine and Slash.
- Added Cosmetic Armor Reworked.
- Added Patchouli - in case some players wanted some in-game documentation for Productive Bees.
- Removed VanillaDeathChest.

### Fixes
- Fixed a Waystone recipe error (Jipok).
- Fixed some console spam (Jipok).
- Disabled Endermites Form Shulker module from Quark, which caused crashes.
- Hopefully fixed MineColonies fishermen not working.
- Some map fixes.
- Fixed Nasty Skeletons not being configured properly. They should no longer knock your armour off or be super strong.
- Fixed a rare issue where players would accidentally place their Dank in maps and were not able to retrieve them.

## [2.7.2] - 2020-12-08

### Updates
- Removed a quest in The Bumblezone that no longer seems appropriate.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Productive Bees, MineColonies.

### Fixes
- Fixed Productive Bees localization.
- Bees with bee cages should be fixed. Please let me know if they're not.

## [2.7.1b] - 2020-12-07

### Fixes
- Fixes bees spawning everywhere.

## [2.7.1] - 2020-12-07

### Updates
- Minor menu changes.
- MineColonies citizens are now very robust.
- Enabled Frostweaver spawns in some cold Overworld biomes.
- Updated Forge to 31.2.47.
- Vanilla Death Chest - increased protection timer from 5 in-game days to 20 in-game days.
- When returning from The Bumblezone, you now appear back where you entered. This makes more sense to me because you're "entering" the hive so you should exit the same place.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Dimensional Dungeons, Storage Drawers, Nasty Mobs, Initial Inventory, Xaero's, MineColonies.

### Fixes
- Fixed Ender Comb quest being uncompletable.
- Fixed Copper Comb and Fossilized Comb issues.
- Fixed some of The Bumblezone quests.
- Fixed Shulker Boxes in Dimensional Dungeons.
- Disabled honeycomb spawning in The Bumblezone due to some generation errors.

## [2.7.0c] - 2020-12-03

- Increased max distance from world spawn from which you can place a colony.

### Mod Updates

### Fixes
- Fixed scripts sometimes not loading I think.
- Shulker Boxes are interactable in maps now.
- Fixed console spam from Mine and Slash.

## [2.7.0b] - 2020-12-02

### Updates
- Note: your corpse will disappear after updating! Make sure you get your belongings before you update.
- Some additional balancing for spells: went a little overboard last patch, ball spells have been buffed a bit again (damage-wise). Cooldowns for all other spells have been reduced GREATLY. Physical spells have been nerfed a bit.
- Changed Corpse for VanillaDeathChest because Corpse wasn't working with MineColonies claims. Shulker Boxes with your items will now spawn upon death. However, this also means that all Shulker Boxes are available to the public in MineColonies claims, so don't use them if you don't want the contents to be stolen from!
- Changed MineColonies config so that Shulker Boxes are available to be interacted with in claims.

### Mod Updates

- Added VanillaDeathChest.

- A bunch of new skills and balance updates in Mine and Slash! General buffs towards ranged users, and changes for more interesting spell gameplay. Also, try out the new physical synergies, or the new Ice Orb spell!
- I've replaced BeeSourceful with Productive Bees. This was a change I wanted to do once things settled down a bit. Productive Bees is basically BeeSourceful on steroids. Also, it's been reported that BeeSourceful slows down world generation heavily - it's possible that Productive Bees will show better results in this regard.
- With the new addition of Productive Bees, it's possible to make a plethora of ore farms!
- Added over 10 new quests to The Bumblezone with the introduction of Productive Bees!
- Nova quest has been made a little less tedious, and the description has been updated.
- Saltion and Bismuth quest description has been updated to better reflect the spawn biome.

- Added more items to Riddle Chests loot tables.

### Mod Updates
- Updated Aquaculture 2, Corpse, In Control!, The Midnight, Xaero's, Performant, MineColonies, Mine and Slash.
- Added Productive Bees.
- Removed BeeSourceful.

### Fixes
- Waystones, Banks, Markets, and Corpses, should all now finally be usable in other peoples claims.
- Inactive colonies should now automatically delete after a week of inactivity - this function has always been enabled but was not working previously.
- Fixed a possible crash in The Bumblezone caused by last update.
- Stuttering caused by the last update should be fixed.
- Various fixes for crashes.

## [2.6.2] - 2020-11-23

### Updates
- Increased max level from 99 to 100.
- Mobs scale at a higher rate now. Level 1 mobs are the same, but level 100 mobs are 33% stronger.

- Beastiary quests have had their EXP nerfed by a factor of 10.

- Downgraded Aquaculture 2.

### Fixes
- Iguanas now drop iguana leather and scales.
- A possible dupe bug regarding coins has been fixed.
- Some Atum related crashes have been fixed.
- Fixed NBT error when nesting backpacks in each other. Do NOT go into creative mode with a backpack though or your items will be wiped! This mostly pertains to dedicated servers.
- That crash involving walruses should be resolved.
- Fixed improper location in description of Mineral Arenthis quest of the Gaia.
- Non-working fishermen in MineColonies should work now. Let me know if it doesn't.

## [2.3.0] - 2020-09-11

### Updates
- Added a new storage solution! Dank Storage compresses NBT data and is relatively simplistic to use. It doesn't interfere with the aesthetic of the pack. I've tied it nicely with Mine and Slash and Create + Immersive Engineering. As a result, I've also added some quests to guide players in crafting the storage blocks. Dank is nice because the storage blocks actually triple up in functionality - they can be used as chests, backpacks, and tools (see in-game for details). Don't worry though! The current bags still have a use... they're just not as good in the late game!

- Fixed some issues with spawning in causing crashes.

## [2.2.5] - 2020-08-27

### Updates

- Added Lootr.

- Added Miner's Helmet.

- Added FPS Reducer - reduces FPS automatically upon inactivity or window minimization.

### Fixes

- Improved village detection on world creation with TerraForged.
- Fixed steel sword reward to be iron sword for a particular quest.
- Trites should spawn in The End.

### Updates
- Ported the changes I made before, The Bumblezone is still optional.

### Mod Changes
- Added Custom Quests.
- Removed FTB Quests.

## [2.2.3] - 2020-08-21
The FTB Quests for Custom Quests change is likely a temporary fix until Custom Quest's rewrite comes out. This will probably result in another quest reset... And I apologize for that in advance. But the problems with current CQ are too great to ignore. The rewrite will likely not be available for a while, anyway. And I still would have to port stuff so that would take extra time. This change lets me make progression a lot more smooth! Thanks for supporting Craft to Exile.

Note: this update does NOT introduce shared questing. That will come with the CQ rewrite!

### Updates
- Working dimension detection, and selectable rewards are now available! This will require a quest reset, sorry! To access the new quest GUI, you'll need to set a key in your controls or use the new quest book. If you're installing a fresh install of [Dissonance], the default key is 'J'. TEAM QUESTING is still not available. I really thought FTB Quests had it, but it will not be implemented, apparently. In a few weeks time, Custom Quest's rewrite will be finished, and I can port all of the quests back over. There will be team questing, and everything nice.
- The Bumblezone is now an optional dimension.
- Added new quests to improve new player experience.
- TerraForged has been added due to popular demand and is the default world type for singleplayer worlds.

- Bosses appear more frequently in maps.
- Reduced damage of all mobs except bosses by roughly 20%.
- Added Mine and Slash ores to chest loot tables!
- Added special cases for Ender Dragon and the Wither. They should be more in line with the power level of other bosses and will always spawn at the max level of their respective zones.

- Added some more Bountiful objectives from other mods!
- Time no longer passes in the Good Night dimensions.
- Reduced Lava Monster spawn rate.
- Updated YUNG's Better Cave generation to be less 'spacious'.

### Updates

- RoughMobs can spawn aboveground again.

### Mod Changes
- Downgraded Performant yet again.

## [2.2.0] - 2020-08-07

### Updates

- Act VII - new dimension: Tofu World! Explore this dimension after you've finished the Midnight... Wait, could this cute dimension be the source of all evil? Don't be deceived by the adorable creatures, they will try to kill you! Get to the Tofu World by making tofu. Grill the tofu and create a portal. You'll also need soy milk as well as a tofu stick (all explained in quest log). You can only craft the tofu stick once you've accessed the Midnight! Tofu World also brings about some new foods to try out!
- Enabled Tofu World compatibility with other mods, including crafting equipment.
- Added a new Act VII chapter in the quest log for Tofu World.
- Progression for The Bumblezone has been reduced from levels 10-18 to 14-18. This change is in part, due to performance issues. But I also find that the zone itself is a little barren at times.

- Added 4 new quests for mechanics that may be overlooked.
- Reduced efficiency of centrifuge, also changed its recipe to use honeycomb.
- High tier honeycomb variants are now harder to come by in The Bumblezone.
- Reduced vanilla mob health. I didn't notice Rough Mobs Revamped was effectively doubling the HP of some of the vanilla mobs... 80+ hp level 2 zombies are not cool.
- Reduced chance for vanilla mobs to spawn with equipment.
- Some general performance changes - should run a little smoother now (YMMV).
- Disabled feral wolves and lammer[...] from Better Animals Plus. It seems like trying to tame them still causes issues even though I thought I disabled taming.
